## Longest Common Substring: 
### Recursive 
(diff from subsequence is introduction of count variable, count resets to zero if a particular letter doesn't match unlike subsequences hwere it remains same)

### Iterative

## Shortest Common Supersequence: 

Idea: len(SCS) = len(str1) + len(str2) - LCSubsequence(str1, str2) 
- substract LCS since, it is counted twice, since it appears in both strings.

## Minimum number of insertions and deletions to convert string a to string b
= LCS(a, b)

## Longest Palindromic Subsequence:
LPS(str) = LCS(str, reverse(str))

## Minumum deletions from string to make a palindrome: 
= len(str) - len(LPS(str))

## Minimum insertions to make a palindrome: 
Idea: The letters that dont participate in the LPS need to be added.
Ans = len(str) - LPS(str) 

## Longest repeating Subsequence: 
Idea: It works same as LCS with an extra condition. That is in the `if` condition, i.e.: `str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]` we add an extra constraint, `i != j`

## Find if `a` is a subsequence of `b`
Idea: if a == LCS(a, b), return `true`
