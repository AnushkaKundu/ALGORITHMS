When to exit the loop? Should we use `left < right` or `left <= right` as the while loop condition?

How to initialize the boundary variable `left` and `right`?

How to update the boundary? How to choose the appropriate combination from `left = mid` , `left = mid + 1` and `right = mid`, `right = mid - 1`?
